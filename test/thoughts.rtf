\f0\fs24 \cf0 How is the image created?\
How does the texture get sliced?\
Can I get the code that generates the animations and slices etc\'85? (Will take a long time to recreate this myself from the research paper).\
^^ I have yet to read the research paper (will do soon).\
This algorithm is used to generate: https://sketch.metademolab.com/canvas ??\
Image is created independently of the animation algorithm?\
Un-pickled the data and Spine may not be feasible in a short term frame due to the difference in data  (and lack of).\
Potentially custom animation system. Unity meshes + animation system?\
\
Anima2d? (6 years ago) - deprecated (replaced by Unity animation tooling)\
\
Unity Mesh class: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mesh.html\
\
There is no slicing with the meta algorithm. This makes Spine less feasible?\
\
Having issues running the meta AnimatedDrawings locally (Docker error but I\'92m using TorchServe)\
\
Spine skeleton .asset files can be created at runtime.\
\
Triangles array would benefit from being flattened when delivered from the server.\
\
Mesh data is rotated 90 degrees when put into Unity format.\
\
Uv mapping issues.\
\
Joint data is not the same scale as vertex data.\
\
Need the A-Pose joints data to correctly setup initialization of the skinned mesh.\
\
Correct bone weights is difficult, if we can extract that data from the meta algorithm it would good.\
\
T-Pose better.\
\
Updated A-Pose data needed to be normalized and x,y flipped.\
\
Updated A-Pose joints seem to be offset by a small amount, relative to the texture.\
\
Updated A-Pose data is out of order. Manually reordered using join data screenshots.\
\
Unity 2d IK Solver.\
\
How to resolve clipping such as when the legs cross when running? Need to check what meta does.}
